        <h2>About Lewis Benson</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! I am a web developer with a passion
          for solving problems and a love for music. My skill set includes
          proficiency in the MERN stack, pair programming, and Jest testing. I
          have over a year of experience in the development industry, working on
          a variety of projects such as building a CRUD application using the
          MERN stack and collaborating on a game based on D&D.
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Skills and Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My background in military service as a heavy equipment construction
          supervisor has honed my leadership and problem-solving skills. I am
          committed to delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds
          client expectations. I am proud of my service and the skills I've
          developed during that time.

        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I am attending Code Fellows, a full-time boot camp in
          Seattle, where I am further developing my web development skills and
          learning the MERN stack. I am excited to graduate in February and
          begin my career as a full-time developer. In my free time, I enjoy
          playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, building computers, and
          exploring new hobbies. I have a passion for learning and am always
          looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge. Thank
          you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy it.
